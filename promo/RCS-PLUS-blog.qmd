Testing conservation strategies under uncertainty reveals which approaches protect ecosystem services across multiple futures
Current conservation planning relies on static assessments of today's conditions, but simulation modeling across diverse scenarios shows which strategies remain effective despite climate change and shifting societal values.
Area-based conservation remains the principal strategy for preserving biodiversity, yet current planning approaches inadequately consider two critical uncertainties: future trajectories of socio-environmental drivers of environmental degradation and preferences for alternate conservation objectives. This study demonstrates how spatial conservation prioritization can be integrated with scenario-based simulation modeling to systematically evaluate conservation strategies under these uncertainties. We simulated conservation area expansion strategies in Switzerland (2020-2060) using a comprehensive full-factorial design testing approaches across five scenarios of climate change, land-use change, and conservation priorities, with strategy robustness assessed through impacts on ten ecosystem services characterized across both space and time. Results revealed substantial variation in ecosystem service provision under alternative futures, with pronounced spatial shifts in service delivery. Critically, only limited spatial overlap existed between regions displaying the highest ecosystem service robustness and areas prioritized for protection based on current ecological value, demonstrating the inadequacy of planning approaches that ignore future uncertainties.
The most consistently robust strategy for securing ecosystem service provision involved rapidly expanding conservation areas to 30% coverage (aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework target), prioritizing small patches in human-dominated landscapes, and employing mixed management combining both preservation and restoration. However, strategy effectiveness varied across different ecosystem services and scenarios, indicating that optimal approaches must account for societal preferences regarding trade-offs between services. This research addresses a recognized gap in conservation planning science and provides both methodological guidance for uncertainty-informed planning and specific recommendations for Switzerland's pursuit of the 30x30 target under accelerating environmental change.
