      <h4>📝 Overview</h4>
      <p>Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by storing 
      carbon, supporting biodiversity, and regulating climate patterns. However,
      rapid deforestation—caused by agriculture, infrastructure development, 
      and illegal logging—poses a significant threat to these ecosystems. 
      To counteract this issue, governments and conservation organizations have
      established protected areas (PAs), which are designated regions where land
      use is restricted to prevent forest loss. While these areas are intended 
      to preserve forests, their effectiveness is often uncertain. 
      This study aims to evaluate whether Cambodia’s protected areas have
      successfully reduced deforestation and to what extent they contribute
      to conservation efforts.

      <h4>🔍 Key Findings</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Protected areas have had a measurable impact on reducing deforestation, but their success varies widely based on location, enforcement, and external pressures.</li>
          <li>Some PAs significantly reduced deforestation, particularly those with strong legal enforcement and active management strategies.</li>
          <li>Many PAs located in high-risk areas (e.g., near expanding agricultural zones and infrastructure projects) were more effective than those in remote, less-threatened regions.</li>            
          <li>Despite legal protection, deforestation still occurred within some PAs, often due to weak enforcement, illegal logging, or encroachment for agricultural use.</li>
          <li>The study also found that some PAs were established in areas where deforestation risk was already low, making their protective impact appear greater than it actually was.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
      <h4>🧪 Methods</h4>
        <p>Rather than simply comparing protected forests to unprotected ones, 
        this research employed a method known as <strong>counterfactual analysis</strong>.
        This technique helps estimate what would have happened if no protections had been put in place. 
        By doing so, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the real impact of protected areas.
        Without using this approach, it is difficult to determine whether a protected 
        forest remains intact because of conservation policies or simply because 
        it was never at high risk of deforestation.</p>
        <p>To conduct this analysis, satellite imagery and deforestation data 
        were examined across different regions in Cambodia. Various factors were
        considered, including land-use policies, road proximity, human population density,
        and historical deforestation trends. By comparing observed deforestation within PAs 
        to a predicted scenario without protections, the study was able to isolate the true impact of conservation efforts.

    <div class="section">
      <h4>🌱 Implications</h4>
          <ul>
        <p>
        <li> Understanding how well protected areas function is critical for improving
        conservation strategies. If some PAs are not successfully reducing deforestation,
        it may indicate a need for better enforcement, improved land management policies,
        or the establishment of protection in higher-risk areas.</li>
        <li> This study highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to
        evaluate conservation outcomes and ensure that resources are directed
        toward efforts that have the greatest impact.</li>
        <li> By refining the selection 
        and management of protected areas, policymakers and conservationists can
        enhance their effectiveness, ensuring that Cambodia’s forests continue
        to provide ecological, economic, and social benefits for future generations.</li>
        <li> This research underscores the need for scientific assessments in
        conservation planning. By continually monitoring and adapting conservation policies
        based on evidence, we can create more effective strategies to combat
        deforestation and preserve Cambodia’s rich forest ecosystems.</li>

      <h4>📝 Overview</h4>
      <p>
      This study explores how land use and land cover change (LULCC) is predicted using models called cellular automata. 
      Typically, models are only evaluated after they simulate changes, but this paper shows that checking the predictions 
      earlier in the process—called <strong>stage 1 validation</strong>—can make models more accurate and easier to understand.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h4>🔍 Key Findings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 1 validation improves transparency:</strong> Early checks reveal problems hidden in final map-only evaluations.</li>
        <li><strong>Not all transition models perform equally:</strong> Some predictions were unreliable despite using advanced methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Individual model checks help:</strong> Looking at transitions separately exposes weak areas like data imbalance.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictor selection improves models:</strong> Removing unnecessary inputs improved performance, especially for logistic regression.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Forests generally outperformed Logistic Regression,</strong> but were less sensitive to input refinement.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
    <h4>🧪 Methods</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Study Area:</strong> Land cover transitions across Switzerland from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed.</li>
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> Swiss national land use datasets were combined with environmental and spatial predictors (e.g., elevation, soil, roads).</li>
      <li><strong>Models:</strong> Transition potential (TP) models were built using <em>Logistic Regression</em> and <em>Random Forests</em> for 174 specific land change scenarios.</li>
      <li><strong>Validation:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li><em>Stage 1 validation</em>: Assessed how well TP models predicted transition probabilities before simulation.</li>
          <li><em>Stage 2 validation</em>: Compared simulated maps to observed maps (used less in this study).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> ROC AUC and Boyce Index were used to evaluate model accuracy and generalizability.</li>
      <li><strong>Variable Selection:</strong> A two-step method reduced redundant predictors, tested for model performance and efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>🌱 Implications</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More efficient calibration:</strong> Stage 1 saves time by avoiding full simulations for every tweak.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved interpretability:</strong> Helps users understand and trust predictions, important for policy-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Need for better tools:</strong> A shared calibration protocol would benefit land change modelling broadly.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports sustainable planning:</strong> Better models mean better decisions for urban growth, agriculture, and nature.</li>

    <h4>📝 Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This study explores how ecological infrastructure (EI)—like wetlands, forests, and green spaces—can be better planned 
      and managed in urban areas. Using Geneva, Switzerland as a case study, we applied a systems-based approach 
      combining social, ecological, and technological data to create spatial <strong>archetypes</strong>. These archetypes help identify how 
      different types of landscapes function and what strategies might work best to support nature and human well-being.

    <div class="section">
    <h4>🔍 Key Findings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Seven distinct landscape archetypes were identified across Geneva, such as “Concrete Jungle” and “Green Frontier.”</li>
      <li>There is a strong disconnect between ecological conditions and social/technological systems in dense urban areas.</li>
      <li>Some archetypes (e.g., Cultivated Oasis) offer high ecological benefits and biodiversity, while others (e.g., Concrete Jungle) are underperforming ecologically.</li>
      <li>Tailored management strategies are needed for each archetype, considering their social and ecological roles.</li>
      <li>Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration, incentives, and spatial planning to implement EI effectively.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local strategies for diverse areas:</strong> Each archetype needs context-specific management approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrated planning is key:</strong> Social and ecological systems must be aligned through smart design and regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>EI is not one-size-fits-all:</strong> Policies should reflect regional variation in land use and biodiversity potential.</li>

    <h4>📝 Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This research explores how to model future land use in Switzerland using scenarios that focus on positive outcomes for nature and society. 
      Instead of simply predicting what might happen, we created five future scenarios—three "normative" (based on goals) and two "exploratory" 
      (based on trends). They used a sophisticated spatial simulation model to test how different choices might shape the landscape between 2020 and 2060.

      <h4>🔍 Key Findings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Normative scenarios led to more sustainable landscapes</strong> compared to business-as-usual or worst-case scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban expansion and landscape fragmentation</strong> were much higher in exploratory scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Protected area expansion and land use zoning</strong> helped maintain ecological connectivity and reduce sprawl.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert feedback was mixed:</strong> while useful, users found it hard to engage with highly detailed simulation maps.</li>
        <li><strong>Key challenge:</strong> making spatial simulation results easily interpretable for strategic decision-making.</li>
